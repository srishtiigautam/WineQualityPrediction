## Introduction

Predicting wine quality is an interesting and valuable task, especially in the wine production industry. This project focuses on using data analysis and machine learning to build accurate wine quality prediction models. By following the steps outlined in this repository, that contains

- Collecting and preprocessing wine data.
- Analyzing the dataset to gain insights into wine quality factors.
- Selecting and implementing various machine learning models.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Predicting wine quality.

## Data

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `.csv` file. It includes various features related to wine properties, such as acidity, pH level, alcohol content, and more.

## Data Analysis

Before building the machine learning models, a comprehensive data analysis is perfomed to understand the dataset better. Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and visualization can be found in the repo. Exploration has been done for correlations, distributions, and key insights that builds better models.

## Machine Learning Models

A variety of machine learning models for wine quality prediction has been employed. The models are implemented using popular libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.

- Regression Models
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
- Classification Models
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
